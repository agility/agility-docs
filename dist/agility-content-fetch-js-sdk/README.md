# Agility JavaScript Fetch SDK Reference

This folder is updated automatically from private Azure Pipelines release. It is triggered whenever an update is made in the corresponding branch in [agility-content-fetch-js-sdk](https://github.com/agility/agility-content-fetch-js-sdk). 

This repository should only ever include a directory listing of versioned docs, and a single index.html that redirects requests to the latest release.

Example:
- 0.0.1 (folder)
- 0.0.2 (folder)
- 0.0.3 (folder)
- index.html (file)
